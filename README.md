Howdy. Welcome to the repository of my *The University of Melbourne's* COMP30023
2023 Semester 1, project 1 submission.
I've supplied a txt file '*versioncontrol.txt*' which summarises the development
of this project pre-upload to this github. 

The project can be constructed using the Makefile commands
* make clean
* make
which will produce an executable '*allocate.exe*'. This program is then run with
the command *./allocate -f <input-file> -s [SJF,RR] -m [infinite,best-fit] -q [1,2,3]*
Please ensure that a working *process.exe* file is included in the directory of 
*allocate.exe* for the program to run successfully.
