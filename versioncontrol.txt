Ello ello marker! Hope your day has been alright so far.

Just read through the rubric now to discover the version control mark. I haven't 
had internet on the device that I've been using to tinker away at this project 
over the past few days, so I didn't bother with a git repository, instead 
opting for frequent local and physical backups between large changes in the code
-- both on the machine this has been submitted from and a USB I have beside me 
right this very moment!

I can't exactly un-work all the code and progress I've made to then resubmit it 
in steps to fulfil this criteria properly, so I figured I'd leave a note here.

Rough order of completion, looking back through backups, is as follows:
    Makefile created w/ "HelloWorld" test in main.c
    Argument reading in implemented w/ constants defined
    process.c initial implementation, moving some constants from main.c to
        process.h file.
    Main.c modified to test `Process` struct allocation and freeing
    ll.c & ll.h node implementation
    ll.c linked list struct and functions implemented
    ll.h / process.h clash resolved when making main.o
    Initial linked list test of processes added to main.c
    main.c process simulation implemented
    Process simulation changed to be non-concurrent (clock validation)
    `unloaded` and `ready` linked lists added with proper simulation
    current_p_node implemented to resolve some logic issues
    Linked list add modified to consider SJF of non-active processes
    Round robin approach extended from current simulation implementation
    Code in clock-running section modified to properly reflect process queuing
        and dequeuing
    Best-fit memory implemented w/out freeing memory
    Simulated memory freeing and best-fit now tied to arguments read in
    A large number of temps/todos removed to tidy code
    First official commit to github
        "Initial commit pre task3.4 from local machine"
    Makefile `clean` fixed, .gitignore added
    README and versioncontrol.txt added to project submission 

I hope this level of logging will suffice for evidence of proper software 
practice.

Have a good one!  c:
